# Personal-Portfolio

This profile page is my first attempt at creating a personal portfolio on the web. I have utilized semantic HTML and CSS properties to highlight different sections about me. You will find comments littered on both the HTML and CSS, helping identify the differnt sections with ease and thus ensuring easy navigation to desired sections. 

I have used colour schemes that not only stand to be professional but also adds contrast between the header and the main body of the portfolio, namely the sections: about me, work and contact info. 

I have utilized extensive research techniques to incoproate icons into the contact me section to increase accesibility. 

I have also used media queries to accomodate for different viewports, ensuring the content isn't lost when different device sizes are used.
